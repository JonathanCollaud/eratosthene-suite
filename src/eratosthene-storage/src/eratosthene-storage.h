     *  \section overview Overview
     *
     *  The _eratosthene-suite_ offers a front-end to the eratosthene indexation
     *  server implemented in the _liberatosthene_ library. It consists in a
     *  softwares suite offering front-end solutions to the functionalities of
     *  the eratosthene library.
     *
     *  The principal software implements the server itself allowing to simply
     *  create instances and maintain services. The suite also offers a
     *  front-end software for the data injection in the available servers. It
     *  also offers a graphical software allowing to browse the 4D worlds
     *  offered by the available servers.
     *
     *  Other tools are also available as the isometric projection creation and
     *  the address and time conversion softwares.
     *
     *  \section project Eratosthene Project
     *
     *  The Eratosthene Project was initially imagined to answer the question of
     *  very large point-based models of cities and environments. Indeed, mapping
     *  a whole city at the level of the centimetre induces very large and heavy
     *  models that are difficult to manipulate, explore and exploit. Moreover,
     *  considering the time dimension implies a quick increase of the size of
     *  the models, making them almost impossible to handle as a single object.
     *
     *  The Eratosthene Project is designed to answer this question by
     *  implementing an space-time indexation formalism able to handle, store
     *  and access very large 4D models of cities and environments. The
     *  indexation formalism is used to implement a server able to manage,
     *  store and broadcast very large 4D models distributed all over the earth
     *  surface and covering large period of time. In addition to the server,
     *  the Eratosthene Project also implements a graphical client able to
     *  communicate with the server and to offer a convenient way of browsing
     *  the models in both space and time.
     *
     *  The space-time indexation formalism is designed to efficiently manage
     *  the storage of the incoming 4D models and to offer and simple and
     *  efficient ways of addressing queries to the server allowing models
     *  broadcasting. The space-time indexation also allows to perform queries
     *  to the server in a intuitive way giving the possibility to both address
     *  the questions of the earth structures levels of detail and time
     *  management. This allows to explore the entire earth surface in terms of
     *  4D structures from large mountain chains in 2000 to very small details
     *  of cities in 1850.
