     *  The _eratosthene-suite_ offers a front-end to the eratosthene indexation
     *  server implemented in the _liberatosthene_ library. It consists in a
     *  softwares suite offering front-end solutions to the functionalities of
     *  the eratosthene library.
     *
     *  The principal software implements the server itself allowing to simply
     *  create instances and maintain services. The suite also offers a front-end
     *  software for the data injection in the available servers. It also offers
     *  a graphical software allowing to browse the 4D worlds offered by the
     *  available servers.
     *
     *  Other tools are also available as the isometric projection creation and
     *  the address and time conversion softwares

     *  and parameters to create the server instance structure.
     *
     *  It then calls the server main function responsible of client connections
     *  management and client thread creation. The server structure is then
