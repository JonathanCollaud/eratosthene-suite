     *  The _eratosthene-suite_ offers a front-end to the eratosthene indexation
     *  server implemented in the _liberatosthene_ library. It consists in a
     *  software suite implementing front-ends to the functionality of the 
     *  indexation server.
     *
     *  The main software implements the server itself allowing to simply create
     *  instance of it. The suite also offers a front-end software for the data
     *  injection in the servers storage structure. Finally, it also offers a 
     *  graphical client allowing to browse the data contained in the servers
     *  storage structure through a 4 dimensional representation of earth.
